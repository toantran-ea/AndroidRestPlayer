### Android Rest Player

### 1. What is it? 
This is my hobby project, inspired by Google Sunflower project to demonstrate the best practice in Android development that I choose. It's a playground for me to play with Android development and experiment things. 

### 2. Does this work produce something helpful? 
Yes! One of the thing at work that I found it's difficult to deal with is to collaborate the API calls with my colleages via Slack when I'm on phone. Imagine the sitation when someone send you a Postman's curl export and you want to run it on your phone. I want this app give the the hand-off experience of Postman running on my Laptop so I can execute and share the API call with anyone at anytime.

### 3. What is the good thing about this repo?
You will find my late nights of work on this project :)) The rest of stack are just normal, including:
- [x] Android MVVM with LiveData support.
- [x] Kotlin coroutines
- [x] Room Database
- [x] Unit test and UI Test with Espreso.
- [x] CI setup with CircleCI (thanks to their free plan)
